# Web-Final-Project
These are my final website projects from both my _Introduction to Computer Science_ of 2025-2026 class and _AP Computer Science_ of 2026-2027 class on my Freshman and Sophemore years of high school. These final website projects count as my final exam for those classes.

## Status: Unfinished
As of right now, I'm just at my first semester project for _Introduction to Computer Science_.

This is a public repository because I'm using **GitHub Pages** to see the real-time website--talking about GitHub Pages, I'm planning to structure this repository as of branhes to easily change through the websites.

# S1 Web Final Project for Introduction to Computer Science
This is my first semester of _Introduction of Computer Science_ class. For the first semester, we learned the fundamentals of HTML and CSS; not JavaScript yet. Although, I already knew a lot of HTML & CSS at this point. 

My first Django (a Python framwork) website was [Gamblecore](https://gamblecore.onrender.com) and I had to use a lot of HTML and CSS. Later on, I also developed my first HTML/CSS/JavaScript website which is [Geography Search](https://mat1020.github.io/Geo-Search/) which I worked alonged [otajan](https://github.com/otajan).


## Requirements
For our websites, we needed to:
- Have an **index.html** and **2 more pages** (so 3 pages in total)
- Have at least **2 CSS files**
- Use images, lists, and smth else

## Summary
So, I created a website that was meant for people to get to know Weezer; _WeezerFan_ is the website name.

The home page is about an overveiew of Weezer like members, popular songs, etc. The second page was an "albums" page about most of Weezer albums. Finally, the third page was "story" which we goes more in depth to the story of Weezer.
